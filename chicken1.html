    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> species, with attributes of wild
        species
        such
        as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeast Asia. Rooster and cock are terms for
        adult
        male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult
        female
        bird
        is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source
        of
        food
        (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.</p>




    <p>Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still
        practiced in some plChickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population
        of
        23.7
        billion as of 2018, <sup> <a href="someource.com">[2]</a></sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are
        more chickens in the world
        than any other
        bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
        literature.
